Please follow the step below for reproduction.

1. Because our folder is too large for the repo, so we have to share the complete file using google drive link, Please download the folder here:

   https://drive.google.com/file/d/18QtEhejdjPWEjL-spLFQ2aRW4BglqhAV/view?usp=sharing
   
2. Here're the package you need to install to setup:

npm install --save-dev dotenv tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer eslint typescript
npm install next react react-dom ethers pinata-web3

3. Then, go to the directory `pinata-nextks` in the terminal, run `npm run dev`, you should be able to see the page at http://localhost:3000/
